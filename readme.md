<Work in Progress>
Project about work management in workplace, on single type of workstation (as part of factory). Based on label cutting workplace in printing house.
Allows:
For worker to fill how much of particular order has been done, and add optional comment to work done (with ability to make alert that something going wrong).
For shift supervisor to manage work orders (adding new, activating, closing, checking status, cloning), with easy to see which orders encountered difficulties.
For system administrator to add and modify other system users
For monitors to check and search specific work data.
Most data shouldn't be deleted, so there is pagination for most data that can be too big to handle.

TODO:
- Priority - modify work order by column priority, and adding default sorting method as it.
- Roles
- More searching methods
- Extend by adding: fixed resources management.
